        <h2>Definiton</h2>
        <p>When you think of a tutorial, maybe you’ll think of the section at the start of a game
           where they show you how to play through really boring and slow dialogue,
           and you just wanna get to the main game and explore already!!
            But tutorials aren’t just that. </p>
        <p>It doesn’t matter if they have a lot of text like a rulebook, 
           a little text like these prompts here, 
            or no text at all. And it doesn’t matter if they’re at the beginning, the middle, or even the endgame. 
            <b>Tutorials are any way of teaching a mechanic to a player.</b></p>
        <p>However, there are still good ways and bad ways of implementing tutorials, 
            and that’s what this page is gonna be about.</p>
        
        <h2>Types of tutorials</h2>
        <p>Tutorials can be broken down into 3 categories:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Tutorials using instructions,</b> in which the game teaches you something through text.</li>
            <li><b>Tutorials using examples,</b> in which an NPC will perform an action and you’ll have to repeat it.</li>
            <li><b>Tutorials using level design,</b> where it’ll teach you something naturally throughout a stage.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>The problem</h2>
        <p>Now, the main problem with tutorials is that they can very easily give either too much information,
            or too little information.</p>
        <p>On the one hand, giving too much information can make your players bored, 
        annoyed, overwhelmed and/or confused, either because they already know everything you’re explaining, 
            or there’s way too much stuff at once for them to process it.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, giving too little information 
        can make your players feel lost and frustrated, because they don’t know what to do or how to play the game.</p>
        <p>Here’s a video with some good examples of this. Be careful while trying to tread that line between over 
            and under-explaining.</p>
        <p>God of War: Ragnarök has a glaring issue with over-explaining, or hand-holding,
            where the characters almost tell you the solution to a puzzle very early on, which is really frustrating, 
            because it takes away the satisfaction of figuring out and executing the solution to that problem on your own.</p>
        
        <h2>The "solution"</h2>
11.	Here’s my “solution”. In my opinion, a great tutorial should be simple, quick, understandable, interactive, and diegetic, or, as I like to call it, SQUID. Simple, because it should explain few concepts at a time, but not too few like we just saw. Quick, because we don’t want to keep the player waiting to play. Understandable, as in easy to grasp. Interactive, because otherwise it may just be a boring slideshow for the player. Diegetic, as in inside the game world, because linking it to the characters and story will make it a lot more charming, and will take the player out of the experience way less. The reason “solution” is between quotation marks is because it’s my ideal way for tutorials to be. You may disagree with it, and more importantly, maybe some tutorials won’t be able to follow these rules 100%, like for example, you’ve got two different mechanics, but you can’t explain one without explaining the other, or there’s a lot to one of them so you have to take a long time to explain it properly. I think that’s okay as well, but maybe try to follow these criteria as much as you can. Here’s an example from Pokémon Emerald, in which you watch this character, Wally, catch this Pokémon, as a tutorial for, well, catching Pokémon. You have to wait for the full battle to play out which is really slow and boring (this is sped up 250%). But, it makes up for it by nicely fitting it into the narrative, and being a simple way to learn the mechanics.
12.	Let’s take a look at how Mario games do it. We saw this a couple weeks ago so I’ll quickly brush over it. Levels in Modern Mario games follow this 4-step design: first, it introduces a new mechanic –like these spinning star platforms- in a safe environment, then it develops it while taking off the safety net. Then it mixes it up with another established mechanic –like the bouncy blocks and Koopas-, and finally it lets you show off your new knowledge in the conclusion. It’s a great way to teach and establish new mechanics, ensuring that you’ll be prepared if they show up in the future.
13.	Now, optional tutorials are a great way to avoid making an experienced player sit through explanations of something they already know like the back of their hand, while leaving in the option for new players to learn the mechanics. In this game, Kirby Super Star, they ask you if you wanna watch the tutorial. Even if you say no, it’ll still play out… BUT imagine if it didn’t!! That’d be great.
14.	The Binding of Isaac does this in a way that I really like. In the very first room you visit, there’s instructions on the floor for all the basic mechanics. There’s no enemies or hazards, so new players can try them out as they please before moving on to the main game, while old players can completely ignore it.
15.	So now, let’s do an activity. I want you to think of tutorials you’ve seen. Think, are they good? Are they bad? See if you can think of why, and share it with the class. Or you can just talk about them, if you’re not sure. [activity]
16.	Great. Now, about the learning curve. The learning curve is the correlation between the learner’s performance and the amount of time or attempts required to complete an activity. So, at first they’ll grow more accustomed to it and begin improving rapidly, and then it’ll get harder and harder to get better. And I think we can use this to pace the tutorials of our game, with time versus mechanics introduced. So, at the beginning of the game you should introduce the core mechanics like movement, and general enemies and items, stuff like that. Then introduce more niche ones progressively slowly.
17.	Super Mario Bros. does this well. You’ve all heard of the “great level design” in the first level of the game. I have the video explaining it here but I won’t play it because we saw it last semester in Game Design class, but I’ll go over it quickly. You start at an empty field in which you can test out the controls, and the character position at the start invites the player to go right, where you’ll find a Goomba. If you touch it, you die, so you learn to jump. You’re invited to jump into the blocks, which spawn a Super Mushroom. If you try to avoid it, you probably fail and collect it, and turn big. Yadda yadda, the game teaches the basic game mechanics right at the start, then introduces new ones more slowly afterwards. I should say this graph isn’t entirely accurate to the game, but I hope it can still convey the idea I’m trying to explain.
18.	Now, the tutorial for Splatoon 3’s story mode begins as a parody of the previous games’, by placing you into a familiar setting, and having this character tell you the Great Zapfish was stolen by the classic bad guys again. You go to some basic-level stages, there’s a twist, and then the real game starts. The problem is, these first stages only introduce one new mechanic, being the little fish you can throw around. The few rest of them were done to death in the previous games. While it may be a fine tutorial for new players, it may get a little grating for experienced ones, since very little new is being shown off, and it makes them expect something predictable and therefore boring. Love the game tho. The first level after the twist contains more than ten jam-packed mechanics from the previous games to compensate for the slow startup. That’s what this sudden rise is. It’s the unbalanced mechanic introductions that make this tutorial feel off.
19.	Finally, we have the first 3 minutes of playtime. What this principle says is basically that you have to have the players get invested and understand the main mechanics in the first 3 minutes of the game. Let’s see how Breath of the Wild does it. [video] This first pan-out invites the player to investigate the pedestal. You have a little empty area to test the movement controls in. These little prompts incite you to interact with chests and stuff. The player is drawn to the glowing thing. Here it forces you to learn about climbing, which is one of the game’s most important mechanics. And then it hits you with this shot of the huge world you’ll be able to explore. Then it establishes your next objective, which is talking to the old guy. Pretty cool :]!
20.	That’s all, thank you for listening.
